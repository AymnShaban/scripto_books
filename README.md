# scripto_books

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

• A Flutter app for browsing programming books with real-time search, and seamless external 
reading .

• Implemented MVVM Architecture pattern with BLoC (flutter_bloc) for scalable state management 
and get_it for dependency injection. 

• Fetched book data dynamically using Dio with the Free books API. 

• Enabled offline design using cached_network_image 

• Designed fluid UI with flutter_animate for smooth transitions and skeletonizer for loading 
placeholders. 

• Streamlined navigation with GoRouter for deep linking and maintainable route management. 

• Integrated url_launcher to open books externally and permission_handler for storage access (e.g., 
caching). 

• Used flutter_svg for crisp vector icons and dartz for functional error handling in API calls. 

• Enabled book downloads by implementing local storage access using path_provider and 
android_path_provider, with runtime permissions handled via permission_handler.
